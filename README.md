# Discord.bot

A powercord plugin that shows a users' details from [discord.bot](https://discord.bot) on the profile modal.

To use the plugin, it is highly recommended that you `git clone` this repo, as Discord does tend to change how components are rendered and added to to the client.

This plugin adds a connection to the discord.bot profile page on the connections tab, and adds a new tab to the profile modal which has the data retrieved from the [discord.bot](https://discord.bot) api.
